  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

          # Example for Jekyll:
          sudo apt-get install ruby-full
          gem install bundler jekyll
          bundle install
          bundle exec jekyll build
          # For Hugo:
